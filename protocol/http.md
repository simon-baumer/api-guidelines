# HTTP

Every API MUST support [HTTP/1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) and **MUST** adhere to its **semantic**.

## HTTP Protocol Quick Start

The understanding of HTTP starts with the understanding of [HTTP message](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages) and its routing.

Once you are familiar with the **HTTP message structure** learn about the **HTTP request methods**, **HTTP response status codes** and **HTTP headers**.

Each HTTP request method, status code, and header have its semantics defined, and every API **MUST** strictly adhere to it.

Follow the [Robustness Principle](https://github.com/adidas-group/api-guidelines/tree/e28e6b756cc7b7bdd2b8784e8ebc2bf452a75377/rest/protocol/core-principles/robustness.md). Use only the HTTP request methods, response codes and HTTP headers you understand, be liberal in accepting others.

## Know HTTP

The following documents are great overview of the HTTP protocol and related standards:

* [HTTP Headers](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/headers.md)
* [HTTP Request Methods](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/methods.md)
* [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md)
* [HTTP Link Relations](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/relations.md)

Alternatively, you can download HTTP cheat sheets at [HTTP posters](https://github.com/bigcompany/know-your-http).
