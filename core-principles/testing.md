# Testing

Every API description \(contract\) using HTTP\(S\) protocol **MUST** be tested against its API implementation. The tests **MUST** be executed using the [Dredd testing framework](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd). The Dredd **MUST** [report the test results to Apiary](https://help.apiary.io/tools/automated-testing/testing-reporter/).

In addition to local runs, the tests **SHOULD** be an integral part the API implementation's CI/CD pipeline. The CI/CD pipeline **SHOULD** be configured to run the test whenever there is a change to either API description \(contract\) or its implementation.
