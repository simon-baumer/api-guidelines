# Version Control System

Every API description **SHOULD** be stored in a Version Control System \(Bitbucket, GitHub\). Where possible the API description **SHOULD** stored in the **same** repository as the API implementation.

> NOTE: The synchronization between the version control system and adidas [API Description platform](apiary.md) should be automated using CI/CD framework.
