# API Design Platform

1. [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) is the primary platform supporting [API first approach](api-first.md). Apiary **MUST** be used during API Design.
2. Every API description **MUST** be stored in [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) under the ADIDAS GROUP team.
3. Apiary **MUST** be the **single source of truth** to learn about existing APIs within the organization.

> NOTE: Apiary supports API-first approach in multiple ways: a. Validates API description for correctness and automatically generates API documentation to drive the discussion between stakeholders. \(No more emails with API description flying between stakeholders\)
