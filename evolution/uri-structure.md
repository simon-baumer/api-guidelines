# URI Structure

URI is meant to express a **identity of a resource**. URI is an identifier and it **MUST NOT** convey any other information.

The API design process **MUST NOT** start with the design of URIs. Contrary, the URI **SHOULD** be amongst the last few things added to the API design.

At adidas, URIs are subject to [naming conventions](https://adidas-group.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/content/evolution/naming-conventions.html).

To read more about the problematics refer to [RFC 7320: URI Design and Ownership](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7320).
